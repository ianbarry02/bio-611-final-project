										<br/>My final dataset for this project consists of 20 books (10 featuring the Third Doctor, and 10 featuring the Fourth). 
										At left is a bar graph depicting the temporal distribution of these stories. Because the novelizations are being used as proxies for televised stories, the years of televised stories are given (rather than the much later, much more scattered publication dates for the books). 
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="visualizations/avg_viewers_year.png" alt="" /></span>
										My past and present analyses of these data emphasize the importance of the microcosm within the story. This is only important when compared to real life. Stories are like laboratories where people can generate and analyze different scenarios. Understanding how people engage (or refuse to engage) with stories can illuminate social attitudes toward specific scenarios, outcomes, or even presentation of characters (as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri_Brown#Makeup_and_costume" target="blank">one character's revealing costuming</a>, enforced by misogynist and predatory BBC employees, which remained popular enough to endure for several seasons in the '80s).
									</p>
									<br/>

									<p>
										However, the average number of viewers per episode over the years (see line graph above) is inevitably skewed by the number of stories I generated data from in each year. I have placed it below my bar graph to facilitate easier comparisons between the number of stories featured in the dataset and the average number of viewers per episode.
									</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="visualizations/character_timeline.png" alt="" /></span>
										<br/><br/>At right is a timeline featuring the major characters included in my final dataset. These do not include all of the incarnations of the Doctor or all of the companions featured on the show during the time period I am looking at, but instead capture the duration of the Third and Fourth Doctors and all major deuragonists and antagonists in the books I analyzed.
